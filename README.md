This project is built for submission to the Encode Austin Hackathon 2022.

One of the purpose of this program is to enable any users to buy forward contract of any raw materials in the world for future months. These purchases are all done on the Solana blockchain so they will always have a smart contract. Besides just buying these contracts, these users can earn interest by staking their smart contracts in any Solana based DeFI platform. 

As the world market prices of these raw materials fluctuates either appreciating or depreciating against the purchase price of the contract, users may suffer losses or profits. However, the additional income of interest would soften the losses suffered or increase the profits from the whole transaction. The current account diagram can be seen in the "Program_and_Account_Diagram.jpg".

I have built these codes using Rust and building Solana accounts using Anchor in the programs/lib.rs file. However, there is still work in progress.

In the future, I hope to turn these smart contract purchases into tokenized smart contract. In that way, the user can lend or borrow funds using these smart contract as a collateral.
